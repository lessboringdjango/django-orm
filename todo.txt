"""
Make a mithril spa that connects over api to a pip installed package that the user installs into their app as the first level
You play the game in your own editor and have the game program running at the same time
It issues a challenge and then you mash check on the game program and it checks, doing juicy things
The pip package hooks into your project and makes the things available through a rest api that the thing connects to
Each level is a challenge to make something happen
charge $30 for it
Make a private forum where you can discuss the answers after buying
Somehow make this clear the database every time through, maybe by running the tests
I could just manually clear out everything before each level
I make the serializer, they have to provide the model
Will probably need some fixtures for later levels
